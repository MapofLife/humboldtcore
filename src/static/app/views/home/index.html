  <h2>Humboldt Core</h2>
<p>
  Humboldt Core is a community-developed standard for representing critical information about scope, method and completeness of biological inventories. The effort to develop and deploy Humboldt Core is described more fully in a paper recently submitted as a Macroecological Methods paper to Global Ecology and Biogeography (full citation below) but in short summary, it provides a means for standarized capture of information that are typically reported in any inventory.  The standard has been developed to be usable across the wide range of inventories that are performed, and has been rigorously tested to assure its usability.  Terms in the Humboldt Core have been carefully cross-walked to other bilodiversity data standards to assure compatibility where possible with other data dictionaries.  A summary Figure below shows the major content captured as broad main categories of general dataset information, spatial and habitat, temporal, habitat and taxonomic coverage along with methodology and effort and completeness reporting.

 Map of Life utilizes Humboldt Core to describe all of the ingested local inventories that are currently available. Our data
curators utilize a best practices guide to do so, located <a href="https://goo.gl/2HXmRA" target="_blank">here</a>. We will
soon further provide tools to filter inventories more effectively according to scope, method or completeness criteria. The
work to standardize reporting strongly facilitates such filtered and faceted searching.

<p>
 The developers of Map of Life want to make it as easy as possible for you to utilize this standard in your own reporting,
and therefore we have provided an <a href="static/app/views/home/HCSupplementalTable3_FullTermList_r2_v4_RW.xlsx" target="_blank"
  ui-sref-opts='{reload: true, absolute: true}'>excel spreadsheet</a>that
has all the terms and their brief definitions. We have some <a href="static/app/views/home/HC_SupplementalTable_ExamplesNEW.xlsx"
 target="_blank" ui-sref-opts='{reload: true, absolute: true}'>examples</a> of using Humboldt Core, again in excel format,
utilizing exemplar published inventories, also
attached.
